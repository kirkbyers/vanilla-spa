# Comments are undervalued

I recently decided to do a small [project/tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URTZ2jKCgBc&index=1&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDd0flgGphKCej-9jp-QdzZ3) in python. However, I wanted to also make the reusable. So before starting I installed the Pylint Code extension. I didn't read much about it before using. While it may have been frustrating to use due to my arrogance, it has improved my code quality from its policies on commenting every module and function.

## Well Duh

A valid Pylint module or function comment is a block comment at the beginning of the module file or declared function. A block comment is apparently enough characters to convince me to actually think about what the comment should say since I'm having to deliberately set up the comment in a particular format. As a result, my small project is thus far very well commented. Furthermore, I'm commenting almost all of my daytime job code (mostly Angular 2) near excessively.

A block comment at the beginning of a block of logic is a very good way to not only communicate the block's intent to future maintainers, but it also allows me to focus in on what this block is doing. If a comment gets to lengthy or technical, then that's usually a sign that something else in the block could be factored out into its own block of logic. 

I know comments aren't anything new, but maybe the common coder doesn't leave enough.

## Results

While I have had one co-work question the number of comments I've left over the last month or so, I have had another directly commend the number and quality. In a workplace with no set style guide, I'm really enjoying laying down some structure. I'll continue to do so, and hope to prevent more future headaches than ever thought possible.
