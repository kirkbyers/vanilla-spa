# Hello world

Hello world, and welcome to my collection of posts. 
No, this is not a blog. This is simply a collection of thoughts
that I feel I should document and occationaly share. As a consumer
of far to many web-dev, start-up, and self-help articles, I feel
that I should start to contribute to the vast amount of content 
already available. I choose to keep these articles here to strength
my skills as a writer before moving to a more public space. You'll 
most likely find a lot of unpolished work here. I am terrible at
spelling and I am not a strong writer. However, I believe that 
creators ship first and foremost. This is an exercise in shipping.
This platform itself is an exercise in shipping. This is static content
hopefully hosted on a cdn that is lightweight and displays nicely on
mobile. It has taken me longer than I would have liked to get this off
the ground. I tend to loose interest in projects after I learn what I 
set out to learn in the first place. Leaving unpolished demonstrations
of fundaments and frameworks. I aim to improve my project completion
rate starting with this project.
