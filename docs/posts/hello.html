<p>Hello world, and welcome to my collection of posts. As a consumer of far too many web-dev, start-up, and self-help articles, I feel I should start to contribute to the vast amount of content already available. I choose to keep these articles here to strengthen my skills as a writer before moving to a more public space. You'll most likely find a lot of unpolished work here. I am terrible at spelling and I am not a strong writer. However, I believe that creators ship first and foremost. This is an exercise in shipping. This platform itself is an exercise in shipping. This is static content hopefully hosted on a cdn that is lightweight and displays nicely on mobile. It has taken me longer than I would have liked to get this off the ground. I tend to lose interest in projects after I learn what I  set out to learn in the first place. Leaving unpolished demonstrations of fundamentals and frameworks. I aim to improve my project completion rate starting with this project.</p>
